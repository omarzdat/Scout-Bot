# Mechanical Design

This is a visual 3D-Render of our robot and its parts, to allow you to explore its dimensions, shape and form! Each of the parts should have been linked accordingly in the poster. These designs were constructed and assembled by our mechanical division, which consists of Hannah and Omar.

Please note that not all visual details are represented. For instance, the screw mounts for the wheels are represented as smooth cylinders, for ease of render as these parts will not be extruded, but will be a part of the axel. Also note that scrutiny of the model and its atriculation, and of each seperate part, is best done on the technical submission files. These files are shared here in STL format, rather than SLDPRT or SLDASM, so that Github can render them out nicely and in a friendly manner.  

All 3D elements in the model are modelled from scratch by our mechanical team, except for the wheels, which have been imported from GrabCAD at the following link: https://grabcad.com/library/tamiya-70192-slick-tire-set-1
