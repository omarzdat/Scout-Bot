# Scout-Bot Repository

This is an online repository designed to accompany the poster intended to showcase Scoutbot. There are various links on the poster that allow the viewer to reach different aspects of the robot; e.g. there are links to view the model of the robot and its parts in 3D, a link to the code, and a link to a more detailed circuit diagram.

This is in no way a complete submission of the technical aspects and should not be treated as such. Scrutiny and marking should be directed at the relevant technical submissions, which are more detailed, better done and definitely more professional. This repository is intended mostly as a novelty and nothing more!

This repository will only remain online for the duration of marking due to concerns of eventual plagiarism next year as this course is reissued. Furthermore, this repository cannot be identified through search by the name of the course, which should keep it protected until it is removed at course's end!
