# Software

This is a repository of the software used to power Scout-Bot! All code was created by our Software teAM, which consists of Sasha and Rory. This is intended as a demonstration of code visually rather than a simulation intended to demonstrate function. Simulations and detailed scrutiny is best performed on the code submitted as part of the technical submission!
