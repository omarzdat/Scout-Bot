# Scout-Bot

This is a visual 3D-Render of our robot and its parts, to allow you to explore its dimensions, shape and form! Each of the parts should have been linked accordingly in the poster.

Please note that not all visual details are represented. For instance, the screw mounts for the wheels are represented as smooth cylinders, for ease of render as these parts will not be extruded, but will be a part of the axel.

All 3D elements in the model are modelled from scratch by our mechanical team, except for the wheels, which have been imported from GrabCAD at the following link: https://grabcad.com/library/tamiya-70192-slick-tire-set-1
